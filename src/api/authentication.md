# API Authentication Guide

Bagisto provides multiple authentication methods to secure your API requests. Choose the authentication method based on the type of API access you need.

## Quick Authentication Overview

| Your Use Case | Authentication Method | API Type | Read More |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public data** (products, categories) | `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` header | Shop API | [Public APIs](#1-public-apis-storefront) |
| **Customer operations** (cart, orders, profile) | `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` + Bearer token | Shop API | [Customer APIs](#2-customer-apis) |
| **Admin operations** (manage products, inventory) | Bearer token (admin) | Admin API | [Admin APIs](#3-admin-apis) |

## Authentication Architecture

All Bagisto APIs are built on a secure, Laravel-native foundation:

- **Laravel Sanctum** — Token-based authentication framework
- **Secure Token Generation** — Cryptographically secure token creation
- **Token Expiration** — Configurable token lifetime
- **Rate Limiting** — Per-key rate limit protection
- **HTTPS Required** — Enforced in production environments

---

## 1. Public APIs (Storefront)

**Best for:** Reading public data (products, categories, prices) without user login.

### The Basics

- **What you need:** `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` header
- **What you get:** Read-only access to storefront data
- **Who can use it:** Anyone (no login required)
- **Perfect for:** Mobile apps, websites, third-party integrations

### What You Can Do

Here are common things you can do with Public APIs:

- 📦 Browse products and get detailed product information
- 🏷️ View categories and subcategories
- 🎨 Get product attributes and variations
- 📄 Read CMS pages and content
- 🌍 Get available countries and locales
- 📮 Retrieve shipping and payment methods (available options)

### How to Use

**1. Get your Storefront Key**

```bash
php artisan bagisto-api:generate-key --name="Web Storefront"
```

You'll get something like: `pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`

**2. Make a REST API request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/products" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

**3. Or a GraphQL request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/graphql" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query { products { id name price } }"
  }'
```


### Key Facts

- 🔓 **Read-only** — You can't modify data, only view it
- 📊 **Cacheable** — Responses can be cached for better performance
- ⚡ **Fast** — No database lookups for user data
- 🚀 **Scalable** — Can handle high request volumes
- 🔄 **Rate limited** — Default: 100 requests/minute per key (see [Rate Limiting Guide](./rate-limiting))
---

## 2. Customer APIs

**Best for:** Building customer-facing features (shopping cart, orders, profiles) after user login.

### The Basics

- **What you need:** `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` header + Bearer token (from customer login)
- **What you get:** Access to customer's personal data and ability to perform actions
- **Who can use it:** Authenticated customers only
- **Perfect for:** Mobile apps, customer portals, checkout flows

### How It Works (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Customer logs in**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/customer/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "SecurePass@123"
  }'
```

**You'll get back:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "token": "IsInRbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

**Step 2: Save the token**

Store the token securely in your application. See the [Introduction Guide](./introduction.md) for recommended storage patterns.

**Step 3: Use token in future requests**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/customers/addresses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer IsInRbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```


### What You Can Do

Once authenticated, customers can:

- 👤 View and edit their profile
- 📍 Manage delivery addresses
- 🛒 Add/remove items from cart
- ❤️ Create and manage wishlists
- 🛍️ Place orders
- 📦 View order history and tracking
- ⭐ Create product reviews
- 🔄 Manage subscriptions (if enabled)

### Key Facts

- 👤 **User-specific** — Each customer sees only their own data
- 🔐 **Requires login** — Must authenticate first (Bearer token)
- 📝 **Read & Write** — Can view and modify data
- ⏱️ **Session-based** — Token expires after some time
- 🚫 **Not cacheable** — Personal data shouldn't be cached
- 🔄 **Requires both headers** — Need `X-STOREFRONT-KEY` AND `Authorization: Bearer`
---

## 3. Admin APIs

**Best for:** Building admin dashboards to manage products, inventory, customers, and system settings.

### The Basics

- **What you need:** Bearer token (from admin login)
- **What you get:** Full control over all store data
- **Who can use it:** Authenticated admin users only
- **Perfect for:** Admin dashboards, inventory management, reporting tools

### How It Works (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Admin logs in**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "password": "AdminPass@123"
  }'
```

**You'll get back:**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "admin": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "admin@example.com",
    "name": "Administrator",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  "message": "Login successful"
}
```

**Step 2: Save the token**

Store the token securely in your application. See the [Introduction Guide](./introduction.md) for recommended storage patterns.

**Step 3: Use token in API requests**

```bash
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/products" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

**JavaScript example:**

```javascript
const token = '<token-from-login-response>';

fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/admin/products', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

### What You Can Do

## Common Patterns
### Public API Request

```bash
# Just need the Storefront Key
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/products" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

### Customer API Request

```bash
# Need BOTH Storefront Key AND Bearer token
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/customers/addresses" \
  -H "X-STOREFRONT-KEY: pk_storefront_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
  -d '{"address": "123 Main St"}'
```

### Admin API Request

```bash
# Only need the Bearer token (no Storefront Key)
curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/admin/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

## Using Tokens in Requests

All authenticated requests require the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. How you pass the token depends on your platform:

**Web/Frontend:**
Use the token from your authentication state, cookie, or session storage.

**Mobile Apps:**
Retrieve the token from secure device storage.

**Backend Services:**
Use the token from environment variables or secure vaults.

For detailed token storage and security guidance, see the [Introduction Guide](./introduction.md).

---

## Security Essentials

✅ **Do This:**
- Use HTTPS for all requests (required in production)
- Include the token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Validate token before making requests
- Handle 401 errors by re-authenticating
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, special chars)

❌ **Don't Do This:**
- Don't hardcode tokens in source code
- Don't log tokens or API keys
- Don't send tokens in URL query parameters
- Don't commit `.env` files to Git
- Don't reuse the same token across environments
- Don't ignore token expiration
---

## Troubleshooting Authentication Issues

### "Invalid API Key" Error

**Problem:** Your Storefront Key is rejected.

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Double-check your key
echo $BAGISTO_STOREFRONT_KEY

# 2. Verify it's active
php artisan bagisto-api:key:manage status --key="Your Key"

# 3. Make sure header name is exactly correct
# Should be: X-STOREFRONT-KEY (with hyphen, not underscore)
```

### "Unauthorized" (401) Error

**Problem:** Your Bearer token is invalid or expired.

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check if token is still valid (tokens expire)
# 2. Login again to get a new token
curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/shop/customer/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password"}'

# 3. Use the new token in your Authorization header
```

### "Forbidden" (403) Error

**Problem:** You're authenticated but don't have permission.

**Solution:**
- If Customer API: Make sure you logged in as the customer
- If Admin API: Make sure you logged in as an admin, not a customer
- Check your admin role has permission for this endpoint

### Token Keeps Expiring

**Problem:** You have to login repeatedly.

**Solution:**
- Implement automatic token refresh (if backend supports it)
- Check token expiration time in the response
- Store refresh token if provided
- Consider longer-lived tokens for backend-to-backend communication
